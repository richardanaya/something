This is a virtual world project of many components

Virtual World Space
- cryptography is identity - if you own the domain, your public keys are valid for verification
- "Server" is mostly pointing toward static data and connecting authorized peers to communicate with client peers
- "Server" is a peer who has an authorized signature to write commands out to other peers
- "Clients" peer is expression what his avatar objects to the world around them, which can be optionally listened to
- "Server" tells clients who else to listen to, server could act as router or aggregators of client data if too many
- connections are verified
- Location configuration on http tells me what webrtc client I should go to to get started and a way to verify their responsabilities
- location based ( non-continual world )
- custom material nodes per object
- animation state per object
- physics of objects are controlled by owner
- scripts are run by owner
- encrypted checksum with increasing message count id ( keep sane security "enough to keep honest people honest")
- every resource is downloaded by cors (resource providers can have their own content)
- communication is mostly concerned about updated position, animation state, material states), cross object communication
- all visible changes are transitions over time, and cancelable by other transitions
- need to have management over who is bogging down our experience, who can communicate with our objects
- "who should I connect with"?

Interface
- Extendable UI Framework
- Seperation of UI and virtual world
- material design
- tablet friendly
- vr friendly

Tools
- 3D Modeling App
- Node editor
- Upload into space
- Sync into space at origin
- Bridge through a client

Expression
- creating modifications of static items you control
- positioning unrigged items on skeleton
- let standards evolve themselves for avatar ( open source preferred )
- Open Source Body
- The base avatar mesh
- animations, etc.
- opens source clothing
- Add to inventory by link
- Inventory management

Communication
- Spacial Communication Overlay
- Identity is cryptography
- secure chat overlay
- profiles
- chat by location
- voice video
- UI

Economy
Assume everything can easily be stolen
- Players control what information they expose an to who
- Tools for managing people based off unique signature
- White lists and black lists
- Bitcoin patronage:
    - wallet
    - tip bitcoin
    - subscribe monthly for access
    - coinbase
- UI handler
